Multi-class (3) imbalanced animal dataset


Process:
- rotation (180 and 90 ยบ) for oversampling
- data split (78 - 16 - 6)
- augmentation - data generator function by keras


Notes:
- performed binary classification for each class
- used "only background" images as another class
- performed multi-class classification (using the background class as well)

- "Without applying augmentation, CNN-1 provided remarkable training, validation, and testing accuracy for the given samples with no overfitting issues (Figure 9a). On the other hand, we observed a large generalization gap in the learning curve while training with a high augmentation threshold (Figure 9b)." - CNN-1 is self-trained model
