# CNN model Naming Convention

---

## **1. Include Model Type**
Specify the type of CNN architecture used (e.g., `ResNet`, `VGG`, `CustomCNN`).

**Example**: `ResNet50_AuthorName_v1`

---

## **2. Author's Name or Initials**
Include the author's name or initials to identify who developed or modified the model.

**Example**: `VGG16_DToretto_v2` (made by Dominic Toretto)

---

## **3. Use Version Numbers**
Adopt a consistent versioning system (e.g., `v1`, `v2`, etc.) to track iterations and improvements.

**Example**: `CustomCNN_WSmith_v3` (third version by Will Smith)

---

## **4. Key Features or Modifications**
Highlight any significant changes or features in the name, such as hyperparameter tuning or regularization techniques.

**Example**: `ResNet50_CNorris_L2Reg_v4` (L2 Regularization of version 4 of ResNet50 by Chuck Norris)

---

## **5. Timestamps for Experiment Logs**
For models generated during experiments, append a timestamp to distinguish between runs on the same day.

**Example**: `VGG16_SDoo_v1_0312` (generated on March 12 by Scooby Doo)

---

## **6. (optional) Give a nickname to the model**
If the model is used frequently, give it a nickname to make it easier to reference.

**Example**: `ResNet50_HMoleman_v1_0312_NiceGlasses` (Hans Moleman's ResNet50 model with a timestamp and nickname)
