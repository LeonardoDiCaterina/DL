# OBJECTIVES (Updated April 4th 20:00)

	Long Term (Delivery):
		- Maximizing prediction quality with respect to our guidelines.

	Medium Term(Next Friday): 
		- Successfully training a model on animal, vis. no animal, and applying transfer learning to a
		more complex labels.

# TODO: Deadline (Monday 14:30, meeting time)
